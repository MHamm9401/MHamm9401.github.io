        <h2>FDA Benchmark Nozzle Simulation</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I recreated portions of a computational interlaboratory study performed by the FDA to analyze blood flow through a benchmark 
          nozzle geometry. I then validated my simulation by comparing simulation results to experimental results obtained in

        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          Per the <a href="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/science-and-research-medical-devices/benchmark-dataset-validating-computational-fluid-dynamic-cfd-simulation-blood-flow-through">FDA</a>:
          "The FDA benchmark nozzle can be used as an early-stage validation of computational fluid dynamic (CFD) models simulating blood flow through blood 
          contacting devices with comparable geometry and flow features. The early-stage validation is limited 
          to velocity and pressure data within the benchmark geometries. The tool provides validation data (pressure and velocity field) obtained from 
          inter-laboratory bench experiments within a generic and simplified nozzle geometry. Modelers can use the pressure and velocity validation data 
          to perform early-stage validation of their computational fluid dynamics (CFD) model/software before performing any device-specific verification,
          validation, and credibility assessment."

        <p>
          The objective of this CFD analysis is to provide:
          <ul>
            <li>qualitative descriptions of flow through the FDA benchmark nozzle at Re=6500</li>
            <li>qualitative comparisons to experimental data </li>

        <h3>Geometry</h3>
        <p>
          The FDA nozzle (shown below) consists of an initial section with diameter 12mm, a taper region, a throat with diameter 4mm, and a sudden expansion 
          back to 12mm. Details of the entrance/exit lengths were left up to modelers.  
        </p>

        <p>
          To prepare the geometry for simulation, three edits were made. First, the geometry was cut in half axially to take advantage of its symmetry. 
          Next, the 90 degree corners at the sudden expansion were chamfered with a radius of 0.2mm to aid in meshing. Last, the entrance and exits were 
          extended to a distance of \(10D_{max}\) to allow flow profiles to develop and minimize artifacts due to the boundary conditions.

        <h3>Meshing</h3>
        <p>
          An unstructured all-quad mesh with edge lengths of 1.5e-4m and 25 inflation layers was generated using the Multizone Quad method and Inflation tool 
          in Ansys Meshing.
          To obtain the appropriate first layer height and total height of the inflation layer, the physical boundary layer height and target y+ values 
          at the nozzle throat were estimated using a Reynolds number of 5000. The displacement height of the flow was calculated using the formula for bounded
          turbulent flows: 
          \[\delta(x) = 1.72\sqrt{\frac{\mu x}{\rho u_{avg}}}\]
          yielding a value of approximately 3e-4m. Therefore, the BL was generated with a total height greater than 3e-4m to ensure total capture of the 
          boundary layer. A target value for y+ was set at 1 to adequately capture the viscous sub-layer of the boundary layer. In theory, the formula
          \[y^{+} = \frac{\rho y u}{\mu}\] 
          can be used to calculate the first layer height. In practice, the first layer was refined iteratively until the target y+ was reached. A summary of
          the final inflation layer settings is shown below.

        <h3>Grid Convergence</h3>
        <p>
          A grid convergence study using four meshes was performed at Re=5000 as per the methods section of Stewart et al. All meshes shared the 
          same inflation layer, and the body mesh sizing was halved each time, achieving a grid refinement ratio \(r\) of 2. The edge length and
          element count for each mesh were: 
        <ul>
          <li>Coarsest: 6e-4m (23k elements)</li>
          <li>Coarse: 3e-4m (42k elements)</li>
          <li>Medium: 1.5e-4m (117k elements)</li>
          <li>Fine: 7.5e-5m (360k elements)</li>
        </ul>
          Recreating Figure 14 from Stewart et al., the axial velocity at the centerline downstream of the throat was plotted for each case to assess qualitative convergence. These results showed that 
          the coarse mesh deviates from the others in its prediction of the jet breakdown region, but that the medium mesh matches the fine mesh. 
        
        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://MHamm9401.github.io/figures/axial_vel_grid.png"
            width="66%"
            class="center"
          />
        </figure>
        In addition, the pressure drop at the nozzle throat was calculated for each mesh and used to calculate the order of convergence \(p\) and grid 
        convergence index \(GCI\) per the <a href="https://www.grc.nasa.gov/www/wind/valid/tutorial/spatconv.html">NASA Spatial Convergance Guide</a>.

        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://MHamm9401.github.io/figures/p_drop_plot.png"
            width="66%"
            class="center"
          />
        </figure>

        <figure>
          <img
            src="https://MHamm9401.github.io/figures/p_drop_table.png"
            width="40%"
            class="center"
          />
        </figure>

        From the data shown above, the order of convergence \(p\) was calculated using the equation:
        \[p=ln(\frac{f_3 - f_2}{f_2 - f_1}) / ln(r)\] where \(f_3\) is the coarse grid, \(f_2\) is the medium 
        grid, and \(f_1\) is the fine grid. Using this equation, the order of convergence was 
        determined to be 6.58789. Next, the grid convergence index \(GCI\) was calculated between the medium 
        and fine meshes and between the coarse and medium meshes using the equation: 
        \[GCI_medium = \frac{F_s |\epsilon| r^p}{r^p - 1}\] where \(\epsilon\) is the fractional relative error 
        between meshes and \(F_s\) is a safety factor of 1.25 suggested by NASA when computing grid convergence 
        over three or more meshes. Using this equation, the grid convergence index was determined to be 7.13738e-5 
        between the medium and fine meshes and 6.86541e-3 between the coarse and medium meshes. Finally, 
        the solutions were checked to ensure they were in the asymptotic range of convergence. This was done by ensuring that 
        the equation \(GCI_{coarse} = r^p GCI_{medium}\) is approximately satisfied. If the ratio of the two values is 
        very close to one, the results both fall within the asymptotic range of mesh convergence, indicating that 
        the results are well converged. In our case, rearranging the equation to take the form 
        \[\frac{GCI_{coarse}}{r^p GCI_{medium}} a\overset{?}{=} 1\] lead to a ratio of 0.99994, indicating that 
        results were well converged. Because of the small \(GCI\) for the medium mesh, and its good qualitative agreement with the fine mesh
        for the jet breakdown region, the medium mesh was selected for use in further simulations.

        <h3>Results  </h3>
        <p>
          Figures 3d, 4d, 8, and 13g from Stewart et al. were recreated by visualizing the following results and comparing them to experimental data:
        <ul>
          <li>Axial velocity along the centerline (Figure 3d)</li>
          <li>Nozzle wall pressure relative to the wall pressure at the sudden expansion (Figure 4d)</li>
          <li>Axial velocity profiles at every other slice shown below (Figure 8)</li>
          <li>Wall shear stress as a function of axial position (Figure 13g)</li>
        </ul>

            class="center"
          />
        </figure>
        </p>

      <h4>Axial Velocity Along the Centerline  </h4>
      <p>
      When compared to experimental PIV data, the \(SST\) \(k-\omega\) model underestimates axial velocity, an effect which is most pronounced 
      in the constricted region. However, the \(SST\) \(k-\omega\) model predicts the jet breakdown location well. This is likely due to the fact that 
      the flow upstream of the throat is laminar. As shown in the axial velocity profiles, turbulent flow profiles are 
      more blunted, resulting in a lower centerline velocity when compared to laminar pipe flow. This partially explains the underestimation of the centerline 
      velocity upstream of the nozzle throat. 
      <figure>

      <h4>Nozzle Wall Pressure </h4>
      <p>
      When compared to experimental data from a pressure tap model, the \(SST\) \(k-\omega\) model underestimates the wall pressure upstream of the constriction, 
      but provides very accurate pressure values in the constriction, throat, and recirculation regions. 
      <figure>
          <img
            src="https://MHamm9401.github.io/figures/Wall_Pressure.png"

            class="center"
          />
        </figure>
      </p>
    
      <h4>Axial Velocity Profiles </h4>
      <p>
      As shown in panels a-c, the \(SST\) \(k-\omega\) model consistently underestimates axial velocity and presents with a much more blunt velocity profile 
      upstream of the throat. Downstream of the throat (panels d-f), the simulation accurately predicts reversed flow and matches 
      the velocity profiles well, qualitatively. As is to be expected from a RANS simulation, flow features 
      are smoothed out compared to the experimental data. 
      
      <figure>
          <img
            src="https://MHamm9401.github.io/figures/all_profiles.png"

            class="center"
          />
        </figure>
      </p>

      <h4>Wall Shear Stress </h4>
      <p>
      WSS at the entrance is high due to the use of a plug flow BC instead of a developed velocity profile BC.  
      As is expected, WSS is low initially and increases rapidly as flow accelerates into the constriction. In addition, 
      WSS just downstream of the throat is higher than elsewhere in the outlet. This is likely due to the 
      presence of turbulent eddies in the jet breakdown region which cause enhanced WSS. Further downstream, as laminar flow 
      returns, WSS returns to the baseline value. It is important to note that due to high uncertainty in experimental WSS calculations, 
      a comparison between experimental and simulation data is of little use. This is a limitation of the current study.

        <h3>Error Discussion</h3>
        <p>
          The main errors associated with computational fluid dyanmics are physical modeling errors, discretization 
          errors, programming errors, round-off errors, usage errors, and post-processing errors. Physical modeling errors and discretization 
          errors are of key importance to CFD analysts, as other forms of error are controlled by software developers and proper use of the software. <br><br>

          In the current study, discretization error has been minimized by ensuring both grid and iterative convergence. Grid convergence was qualitatively and 
          quantitatively assessed in a grid independence study. In addition, the use of high-resolution inflation layers helped ensure that boundary layer flows
          were adequately captured. To ensure tterative convergence, conservation of mass and energy were tracked using residuals, and convergence on a solution 
          was tracked through pressure and velocity monitors. <br><br>

          There is, however, a major physical modeling error in the current simulation: the use of the \(SST\) \(k-\omega\) turbulence model in the upstream 
          region where flow is laminar. There is a tradeoff between accuracy in the laminar region and accuracy in the transitional and turbulent regions. As 
          turbulent flow is of more interest to most analyses, the use of a turbulence model is still justified. To assess the magnitude of the physical modeling
          error, qualitative validation against PIV and pressure tap experiments was performed. This validation showed that the current simulation adequately 
          predicts the jet breakdown location, pressure drop in the throat and recirculation region, and velocity profiles everywhere except the inlet region. 
          This suggests that the current simulation can be considered accurate enough for qualitative flow predictions. However, due to high experimental 
          uncertainty, a quantitative validation could not be performed for this case. <br>
