        <h3>Evolution of Turbulence in Stenotic Blood Flow</h3>
        <figure>

          Pulsatile blood flow past a stenosis with a peak Reynolds number of 3500 was simulated using open-source computational fluid dynamics 
          software SimVascular. This Reynolds number resulted in a transition to turbulence. In order to capture all scales of turbulence, the Kolmogorov
          length scale was estimated, and the mesh resolution was set accordingly. Results were analyzed in Paraview (an open-source software). Streamlines 
          were generated, and corresponding vortex cores were visualized using Q-criterion isosurfaces. Interesting flow structures were then isolated and 
          used to create two symmetric patterns. <br> <br>

          Turbulent blood flow is associated with increased shear stress on artery walls and red blood cells, negatively affecting blood vessel wall remodeling.
          The transition from laminar to turbulent flow due to a stenosed blood vessel was simulated using computational fluid dynamics (CFD). Simulation results
          are visualized in the middle panel of this figure. Upstream, flow streamlines are smooth and ordered. Downstream, velocity increases and chaotic 
          vortices quickly form. To generate the side panels, flow structures and vortex cores from the transitional (left panel) and turbulent (right panel)
          flow regions were extracted and arranged in kaleidoscope-like patterns.
