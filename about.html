          I am a Biomedical Engineering student that is interested in both in-silico and in-vitro modeling of cardiovascular devices and anatomy. Outside of 
          engineering, my hobbies include  <a href="/photography.html">macro photography</a> and rock-climbing.

          I have worked under Dr. Vitaliy Rayz and Dr. Neal Patel in the <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/CFML">Cardiovascular Flow Modeling Lab</a>
          since my sophomore year. Under their outstanding mentorship, I have developed both a passion for computational modeling and the skills needed to 
          be a successful researcher. My major projects were on morphological risk factors in cerebral aneurysms and machine learning for enhancing 4D flow MRI,
          and I have had the opportunity to present at multiple research conferences.

        <h2>Cook Research Incorporated</h2>
        <p>
          I worked as an intern on Cook Research Inc.'s bench testing team for 17 months. 
          My work had four main components: 
          <ol>
            <li>Performing verification & validation testing of endovascular devices </li>
            <li>Designing and validating state-of-the-art test methods</li>
            <li>Collaborating with Computer-Aided Engineering to align in-vitro and in-silico models </li>
            <li>Writing regulatory justifications in support of international regulatory submissions</li>
          </ol>
          I was able to have a broad range of projects that fostered a passion for in-vitro modeling and taught me to be adaptable and innovative.
