        <h2>Piston Fluid-Structure Interaction Simulation</h2>
        <p>
          In this project, I simulated compression of an ideal gas in a 2D piston in
          Python without the use of dedicated CFD libraries.

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          As a biomedical engineer, I am interested in modeling the cardiovascular system. 
          In particular, I am interested in cardiac flows, which are often investigated 
          through fluid-structure interaction simulations with moving walls. I wanted to
          maintain the concept of a moving wall while simplifying the problem to a practical 
          level. Therefore, I chose to model a piston compressing an ideal gas.

        <h4>Moving Wall Boundary Condition</h4>
        <p>
          The moving wall is implemented in two steps. In the first step, the program identifies which mesh elements the wall is currently in and imposes 
          a rigid slip wall condition on their west walls. However, this approach can only capture element-sized movements of the wall. In order to capture 
          intra-element movement, a second step is needed. In the second step, the program calculates the fraction of the cell occupied by the wall \(f_wall\)
          and the change in effective volume of the cell \(\frac{\delta V}{V_0}\) according to the following equations: <br>
          The initial volume of the cell is \(V_0 = dx*dy\) <br>
          The change in effective volume in one time step is \(\delta V_step = u_wall * dt\) <br>
          The wall fraction is \(f_wall = \frac{\V_wall}{V_0}\) <br>
          
          \[\frac{\delta V}{V_0} = f_wall * \frac{u_wall * dt}{dx}\] <br>

          
          
          
          
          change in effective volume of the element that the
          wall is currently in. This change in volume is used to update the density
