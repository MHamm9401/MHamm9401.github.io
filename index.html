          In this project, I simulated compression of an ideal gas in a 2D piston in
          Python without the use of dedicated CFD libraries.

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <p>
          As a biomedical engineer, I am interested in modeling the cardiovascular system. 
          In particular, I am interested in cardiac flows, which are often investigated 
          through fluid-structure interaction simulations with moving walls. I wanted to
          maintain the concept of a moving wall while simplifying the problem to a practical 
          level. Therefore, I chose to model a piston compressing an ideal gas.

        <h4>Moving Wall Boundary Condition</h4>
        <p>
          The moving wall is implemented in two steps. In the first step, the program identifies which mesh elements the wall is currently in and imposes 
          a rigid slip wall condition on their west face. However, this approach can only capture element-sized movements of the wall. In order to capture 
          intra-element movement, a second step is needed. In the second step, the program calculates the fraction of the cell occupied by the wall \(f_{wall}\) 
          and uses it to update the variables in cells adjacent to the wall. Pressure is simply extrapolated from the adjacent cell. 
          Velocity is set as a weighted average of the wall's velocity \(u_{wall}\) and the fluid velocity from the previous time step \(u_{fluid}\). 
          Density is updated based on the change in effective area (i.e., area not occupied by the wall) which is calculated according to the following equations: 
          The initial area of the cell is \[V_0 = dxdy\]
          The change in effective area in the current time step is \[\Delta V_{step} = u_{wall}dydt\]
          The accumulated change in effective area is \[\Delta V_{accumulated} = f_{wall}dxdy\]
          Finally, the total change in effective area of the cell is \[\frac{\Delta V_{total}}{V_0} 
          = \frac{(f_{wall}dxdy)(u_{wall}dydt)}{dxdy} 
          = \frac{f_{wall}u_{wall}dt}{dx}\]
          Conservation of mass for the control area is \[\rho_0 V_0 = \rho^{'} V^{'} = \rho^{'} (V_0 - \Delta V_{total}) \]
          where prime denotes the updated variable. Simplification leads to \[\rho^{'} = \frac{\rho_0}{1-\frac{\Delta V}{V_0}}\] 
          Substituting in the change in effective area yields the formula for updating near-wall density \[\rho^{'} = \frac{\rho_0}{1-\frac{f_{wall}u_{wall}}{dx}}\]
          Finally, continuity is enforced by finding the mass displaced by the piston and adding it to the adjacent cell.

        <h3>Wall Tracking Verification</h3>
        <p>
          Before coding the physics of the moving wall, verification of the wall tracking was performed. There were three parameters of interest: 
          <ol type="1">
            <li>Wall position</li>
            <li>Wall index </li>
            <li>Wall fraction </li>
          </ol>
        A simulation was run until the wall advanced approximately 1.5m into the domain. Afterwards, the calculated wall position was evaluated 
        to ensure it matched hand calculations based on the time and velocity. <br>
        <video width="640" height="480" controls>
          <source src="https://github.com/MHamm9401/MHamm9401.github.io/raw/main/figures/LF1_Wall_NoPhysics.mp4" 
            type="video/mp4"
          >
        </video>    
        <br>
        The wall index calculated by the code was compared to hand calculations and plotted to ensure that a pattern of repeated step functions occurred. 
        Finally, the wall index was compared to hand calculations and plotted to ensure that it was bounded between 0 and 1. <br>

        <h3>Continuity Verification</h3>
        <p>
          After completing the physics of the moving wall, simulations were run and conservation of mass was verified by multiplying the sum of the density by the instantaneous 
          effective volume of the piston. On the first iteration of the boundary condition, the piston lost a significant amound of mass as shown below. <br>
        <figure>
          <img
            src="figures/CoM_noFluxBC.png"
            width="630"
            height="475"
            class="center"
          />
        </figure>
          This led to the addition of a Neumann mass flux condition to enforce conservation of mass. After this addition, continuity was signficantly 
          improved. However, when the wall enters a new cell, there is still some change in the mass of the system. 
          Overall, there is a transient spike in mass, but the mass then levels out and remains stable, as shown below.

      <section id="validation">
        <h2>Validation</h2>
        <p>
          In a piston, it is important to be able to accurately predict the pressure and volume of the system. 
          Therefore, the pressure-volume term of the ideal gas law was chosen as a validation quantity. Neglecting heat transfer, PV is a 
          constant in an ideal gas system. 
          <ul>
            <li>Initial: P = 101,000Pa V = 4m^2, PV = 404,000J</li>
            <li>Final: P = 124,531Pa V = 3.04m^2, PV = 378,574J</li>
            <li>Error of approximately 6.5% in quantity of interest</li>
          </ul> 
          While there is a lot of room for improvement, a prediction within 10% may be useful in a quick-and-dirty analysis.
